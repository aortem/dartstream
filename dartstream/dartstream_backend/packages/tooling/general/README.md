# DartStream

## Core Testing Packages

Enhance your testing workflow with these integrated core testing packages included in DartStream:

- **test**: Provides a solid foundation for writing and running unit and integration tests in Dart.
- **mockito and mocktail**: Facilitate the creation of mock objects. While Mockito is used for non-null safe code, Mocktail offers full support for Dart's null safety.
- **build_runner**: A powerful tool for generating code, running source generation, and more.
- **build_test**: Assists in testing code that uses build_runner for generation.
- **coverage**: Measures how much code is covered by tests, helping to ensure thorough testing of your application.

### Using the Testing Packages

To effectively use these packages, include them in your `pubspec.yaml` under `dev_dependencies`. Here is a basic guide to get you started:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  test: ^latest
  mockito: ^latest
  mocktail: ^latest
  build_runner: ^latest
  build_test: ^latest
  coverage: ^latest
```
