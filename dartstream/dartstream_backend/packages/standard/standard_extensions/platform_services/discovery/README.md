# Key Improvements

## Error Handling:

- Detects and reports invalid dependency formats in manifest.yaml (e.g., missing >=).

- Provides clear messages for invalid manifest structures.

## Camel Case Enforcement:

- Dependency names must match camel case conventions exactly.

- If needed, normalization can be added (e.g., _normalizeCamelCase()).

# Improved Logging:

- Logs more detailed messages for missing files, invalid formats, and errors.

# Registry Save Error Handling:

- Ensures that errors during registry save are caught and logged.
