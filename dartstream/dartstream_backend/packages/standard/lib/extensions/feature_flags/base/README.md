# DartStream

## DS Standard Packages

DS Standard packages allow you to utilize core dart features maintained by the Dart team.  The depdendencies remain largely unmodified.  Dartstream extends the built-in classes and methods, therefore allowing developers the greatest composition flexibility when building their applications.

## Package Conflicts and Aliases

In some cases, core dart package have naming conflicts (ie. same method, classname).  For some packages, we build wrappers and use the DS prefix to avoid those conflicts.  

In other cases, where may avoid using a package altogether.  We will keep the documentation up to date as often as possible.

## Licensing

All Dartstream packages are licensed under BSD-3, except for the *services packages*, which uses the ELv2 license, and the *Dartstream SDK packages*, which are licensed from third party software Aortem Inc. In short, this means that you can, without limitation, use any of the client packages in your app as long as you do not offer the SDK's or services as a cloud service to 3rd parties (this is typically only relevant for cloud service providers).
