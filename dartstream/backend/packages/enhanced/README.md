# DartStream

## DS Enhanced Packages

DS Enhanced Packages are any packages that are not built by the core dart team.  Many of these packages greatly enhance functionality to the Dart core.

Third party packages are actually broken up into several different categories depending on the use case:

- authentication
- database
- file-storage
- google_dev
- payments
- general_third_party

## Package Conflicts and Aliases

As expected, package conflicts and naming conventions may exist.  Dartstream attempts to build a consist base class across all third party packages with proper DS prefix in order to ensure smooth interoperability with the core dart packages and dartstream custom packages.

We carefully curate packages that we believe may be of significant value to our users and provide a smooth experience.  

## Licensing

All Dartstream packages are licensed under BSD-3, except for the *services packages*, which uses the ELv2 license, and the *Dartstream SDK packages*, which are licensed from third party software Aortem Inc. In short, this means that you can, without limitation, use any of the client packages in your app as long as you do not offer the SDK's or services as a cloud service to 3rd parties (this is typically only relevant for cloud service providers).  See the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file for more details.
